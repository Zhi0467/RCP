    Discovery is the seam every unconfigured local provider execution passes
    through: readiness runs `--version`, `login status` and `debug models`
    through the path it returns, and a turn's own `codex exec` is built from
    that same path. No fixture configures a binary, so leaving discovery live
    meant a test that dispatched a task prompted the developer's own
    authenticated CLI and billed a real provider turn no assertion ever read.
    Returning nothing makes readiness `unconfigured`, which refuses the launch
    before a command is built.

    Readiness reaches this only for an unconfigured local provider, so an
    explicit `binary=` is unaffected; that is how the env-gated live
    qualification in `test_server_provider_readiness_live.py` still probes a
    real CLI on purpose. A test that needs a configured provider patches
    `AgentLauncher.readiness` or replaces `BackgroundAgentTasks.stream`; one
    that needs a real child process stages its own stub through
    `sys.executable`.

    `real_provider_discovery` opts a test out. It is for the unit tests of the
    helper itself, which already stub `shutil.which` and `pwd.getpwuid`, so
    they reach no installed binary either.
